1;Flanders;6444000;FLA;233433000000;13522;Brussels;1;2;BE;Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium and one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. In the second half of the 20th century, however, Flanders' economy modernised rapidly, and today Flanders and Brussels are significantly more wealthy than Wallonia and in general one of the wealthiest regions in Europe and the world.;
2;Wallonia;3602216;WLN;95443000000;16844;Namur;2;1;BE;The French Community of Belgium encompasses both Wallonia and the majority French-Speaking Brussels-Capital Region. During the industrial revolution, Wallonia was second only to the United Kingdom in industrialization, capitalizing on its extensive deposits of coal and iron. Since World War II, the importance of heavy industry has greatly diminished, and the Flemish Region surpassed Wallonia in wealth, as Wallonia declined economically. Wallonia now suffers from high unemployment and has a significantly lower GDP per capita than Flanders. The economic inequalities and linguistic divide between the two are major sources of political conflicts in Belgium and is a major factor in Flemish separatism.;
